File name and class name should be same and class name should always be in capital letter

System is a class that is why it starts with capital S


public static void main(String[] args)

Method have a camel vent lower case to upper case 

2 types of variable 

Global variable : inside a class 
Data type variable and the equal value 

Local variable : declared under method is local variable.


// single line comment 

main method is like a entery point of program.

we need () for method 

String [] args : we can have multiple values for this 

like this String [] args : {"welcome","hello","hey"};

String s = welcome 

void means nothing will be returned

 Static  

public access modifier




Anything with static will be loaded in the class first 
Memory 
1.class is loaded 
2.static is loade
